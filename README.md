# Combinatorics

**Combinatorics** contains static functions to generate **_k_**-permutations and **_k_**-combinations (in both cases either with or without repetition) of the **n** elements in an array.

## Compatibility

**Combinatorics** requires iOS 8+ and is compatible with Swift 2 projects.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Installation for [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is simple enough:

    use_frameworks!
    pod 'Combinatorics'

And `import Combinatorics` in the files you would like to use it.

### Old school

Just drag the file `Combinatorics.swift` into your project. That is all you really need. Or if you just need a function or two, copy and paste that function into your project. At the end of the day **Combinatorics** is only a collection of static functions that could also be defined as global functions.
